## Hello !!
### About me ! 
I am currently a undergraduate student at Newcastle Univeresity, studying digital cultures and media. I am in my third and final year and currently creating my dissertation project. This project aims to discuss the problems with gender and identity in raves. I am going to present this research through a narrative driven game created on gamemaker. This will be presented alongside a 3,000 word commentary on a HTML page with the link to the game embedded. My predicted grade is currently a 2:1 however i am aiming to achieve a high first which i think is achievable with commitment and hard work.

I am currently learning javascript and i am aiming to also improve my HTML and CSS skills as i enjoy creating webpages and hoping to learn how to create apps to go along side this. On the side of learning these i want to improve my data visualization skills and scratch up on my excel work too.
